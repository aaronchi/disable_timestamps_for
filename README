= disable_timestamps_for

Selectively disable timestamping on specific fields in an ActiveRecord model.

== Basic Usage

Just add disable_timestamps_for to any of your ActiveRecord models and define the field or fields for which you would like to skip timestamping.

	class List < ActiveRecord::Base
		disable_timestamps_for :position
	end
	
	class ListItem < ActiveRecord::Base
		disable_timestamps_for [:position, :list_id]
	end
	
Rails will now disable timestamping on updates if these are the only fields that have changed.

== Compatibility

Rails 2.1 + (uses dirty tracking)
